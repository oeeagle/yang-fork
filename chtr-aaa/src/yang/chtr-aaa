	    	where name describes the NTP service, device is a list <aaa-host-1> is madatory and <aaa-host-2> and <aaa-host-3> are optional
	    	Each service instance is made unique by the declaraion of <name> and the ordered combination of aaa-hosts. The devices added to 
	    	this service act as subscribers to the service RATHER than the service being dependent upon the devices";
