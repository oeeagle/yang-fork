      "The model has been shifted to support both local and remote AAA, the aaa-host statements have been updated to support either ipv4 or ipv6 server addresses,
       calea specific components have been moved to calea.yang. The device leafref has been updated to utilize the entity model for device lookups
       and a must statement has been added to the device lookup which ensures that once a device is only a member of a single aaa service group.

       new set statement(s):
       set services chtr-aaa <groupname> <device> local-auth local-username <string> vtypass <string> enablepass <string>
       set services chtr-aaa <groupname> <device> remote-auth shared-secret <string> aaa-host-1 <inet:ipv4-address|inet:ipv6-address> aaa-host-2 <inet:ipv4-address|inet:ipv6-address> aaa-host-3 <inet:ipv4-address|inet:ipv6-address>

       note:
       I could see the aaa server information for a specific device group being added to the engdb in future revisions.
