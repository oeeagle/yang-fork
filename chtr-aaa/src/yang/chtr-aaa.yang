       The goal of this service is to support the user input of 'set service chtr-aaa <name> [device] <aaa-host-1> <aaa-host-2> <aaa-host-3>'
       where name describes the NTP service, device is a list <aaa-host-1> is madatory and <aaa-host-2> and <aaa-host-3> are optional
       Each service instance is made unique by the declaraion of <name> and the ordered combination of aaa-hosts. The devices added to
       this service act as subscribers to the service RATHER than the service being dependent upon the devices";
