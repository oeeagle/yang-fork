== Simple MPLS Layer3 VPN Example

=== Example Overview

This example illustrates Layer3 VPNs in a service provider MPLS
network.

==== Example Network

The example network consists of Cisco ASR 9k core routers (P and PE)
and Cisco IOS based CE routers.

=== Known Issues/Simplifications
Interface type of GigabitEthernet for Cisco routers is hard coded.
Netmasks of link networks is hardcoded to /30 and to /24 for local
networks.
Service provider as-number is hardcoded to 100.

=== Running the Example in the CLI
Make sure you start clean, i.e. no old configuration data is present.
If you have been running this or some other example before, make sure
to stop any NCS or simulated network nodes (ncs-netsim) that you may have
running.  Output like 'connection refused (stop)' means no previous
NCS was running and 'DEVICE ce0 connection refused (stop)...' no
simulated network was running, which is good.

----
make stop clean all start
ncs_cli -u admin -C
----

This will setup the environment and start the simulated network.

==== VPN Service Configuration in the CLI

Before creating a new L3VPN service we must sync the configuration
from all network devices and then enter config mode.

Lets start by configuring a VPN network.

 endpoint c1
  as-number 65001
  ce device ce0
  ce local interface-name GigabitEthernet
  ce local interface-number 0/9
  ce local ip-address 192.168.0.1

  ce local interface-number 0/3
  ce local ip-address 192.168.1.1
  ce link interface-name GigabitEthernet
  ce link interface-number 0/1
  ce link ip-address 10.2.1.1
  pe device pe2
  pe link interface-name GigabitEthernet
  pe link interface-number 0/0/0/2
  pe link ip-address 10.2.1.2

Before we send anything to the network, lets see what would be sent if
we committed.
----
commit dry-run outformat native
----

The output is too large to include here but as you can see each CE
device and the PE router it is connected to will be configured.
Lets commit the configuration to the network

You can give the CLI pipe flag 'debug template' to get detailed
information on what configuration the output will effect, and how, the
result of XPath evaluations etc. A good way to figure out if the
template is doing something wrong:

----
commit dry-run | debug template
----

----
commit
