== Simple MPLS Layer3 VPN Example

=== Example Overview

This example illustrates Layer3 VPNs in a service provider MPLS
network.

==== Example Network

The example network consists of Cisco ASR 9k core routers (P and PE)
and Cisco IOS based CE routers.

=== Service Development Process

This section outlines a the development process that was used when
creating this example.

==== Step 1 - Define correct device configurations
Start by creating/defining the device configurations you want to have
in your network for a correctly provisioned service. This is typically
something that is done together with the network engineers.

Look in directory STEP1 for config snippets

==== Step 2 - Create service model
Analyze the device configurations to see what parameters can be
abstracted to a service model, use that together with the knowledge of
how requests will come to NCS to create the service.

Create your service YANG model.

Look in packages/l3vpn/src/yang/l3vpn.yang

==== Step 3 - Create service template

Use the config snippets created in step1 and configure either a
ncs-netsim simulated device or a real device. 
If you use a netsim simulated device do "show running-config | display
xml" to get the template output. 
If you use a real device, connect it to NCS, run device sync-from and
do "show running-config device device <mydevice> | display xml"

Add all the xml snippets to the file:
packages/l3vpn/templates/l3vpn.xml

Replace the values you configured with references to the parameters
from service model.
